## Summary
Implements batch execution support with parallel processing, progress tracking, and result aggregation.

## Related Issue
Closes #24

## Changes
- Created `BatchExecutor` class (`src/playbooks/batch.py`):
  - Parallel execution with configurable concurrency (asyncio.Semaphore)
  - Progress tracking with live updates during execution
  - Continue-on-error mode (default: true)
  - Individual execution timing metrics

- Created `BatchResult` class:
  - Captures individual playbook execution results
  - Tracks success/failure status, duration, errors
  - Preserves input context and execution trace
  - Serialization support (to_dict)

- Created `BatchResults` class:
  - Aggregates results with statistics
  - Properties: total, success_count, failure_count, avg_duration_ms
  - Export to JSON format (to_json)
  - Export to CSV format (to_csv)

- CLI tool (`python -m src.playbooks.batch`):
  - Batch execution from JSON inputs file
  - --max-concurrency: Control parallel execution limit
  - --progress: Show live progress updates
  - --stop-on-error: Stop on first failure
  - --output: Export results to JSON/CSV
  - Exit code: 0 for all success, 1 if any failures

- Updated `src/playbooks/__init__.py`:
  - Export BatchExecutor, BatchResult, BatchResults

- Comprehensive unit tests (`tests/unit/test_batch.py`):
  - 19 test cases covering all functionality
  - 69% coverage on batch module

## Testing
- [x] Unit tests added (19 tests)
- [x] All tests pass (194 tests total)
- [x] 84% code coverage (exceeds 80% requirement)
- [x] All linters pass

Ready for review!
